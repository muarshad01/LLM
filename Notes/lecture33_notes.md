## LLM finetuning approaches

* __Finetuning__: Adapting a pretrained model to a specific task by training the model on additional data.

#### What is LLM Fine-tuning?

* Fine-tuning LLM involves the additional training of a pre-existing model,
which has previously acquired patterns and features from an extensive data set, using a smaller, domain-specific dataset. In the context of "LLM Fine-tuning," LLM denotes a "Large Language Model," such as the GPT series by OpenAI.

#### Finetuning Types
1. Instruction finetuning
* Training a language on a set of tokens using specific instructions
* Can handle broader set of tasks
* Larger datasets, greater computational power needed
* LoRA / QLoRA
* LoRA: Two smaller martices that approximate a larger martirx are fine-tuned.
2. classification finetuning
* Model is trained to recognise a specific set of class labels, such as spam or no spam
