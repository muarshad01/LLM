## Build an LLM from Scratch

#### Instructor
* My name is __Dr. Raj Dander__. I graduated from IIT Madras with a BTech in ME in 2017. After that, I did my PhD from the MIT. I graduated from MIT with a PhD in ML in 2022. Since then, I've come back to India and we are all on a mission to basically make AI accessible to everyone. At [Vizura](https://www.youtube.com/@vizuara), which is our YouTube channel, we have made several playlists now on ML on DL. The main approach or the philosophy, which we really follow, when we teach, is to __teach everything from the basics__, i.e., not to assume anything. Teach you the __nuts and bolts__ of every single concept. 

* We all know that __LLM and GenAI__ are transforming everything around us. But many people when they are learning about this field are making __one common mistake__: they directly-switch to the applications, they directly-run some [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). They follow some YouTube video and directly-run a code.
   * But very few people really understand __how LLM actually work?__
   * Very few people actually know the __nuts and the bolts__, which make LLM really so powerful.
   * Wouldn't be it amazing if you can __build an LLM completely from scratch?__
   * Teach to you everything from the basics as a beginner without assuming anything.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* One of the first __Chatbots__, which humans developed, is called as __ELIZA__. It was supposed to be a therapist, and let's see how it works:
    * Eliza: ...
     * You: ...
* You see this conversation is proceeding nowhere. It's not very good right!

#### LLM: ChatGPT
* What are LLMs?
* I am trying to learn about LLMs tell me some resources?
* You'll see the response by [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&utm_campaign=GOOG_C_SEM_GBR_Core_CHT_BAU_ACQ_PER_MIX_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_091724&utm_term=chat%20gpt&utm_content=169187630042&utm_ad=744024536836&utm_match=e&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21714513245&gbraid=0AAAAA-IW-UWNf0Ud4PR0_8F6Nft0JFmBR&gclid=CjwKCAjw-svEBhB6EiwAEzSdrr5KPGN3_0OKZos5P8APgBeKU3Qg-VJxLpT9gYIz4YcCMzQs-5ZSZRoCcBQQAvD_BwE). It's extremely useful, it's to the point and it gives me books, it gives me online courses, it gives me research papers, this is exactly what I need.
* __LLM such as GPT__ are very powerful they are very sophisticated.
* There are several more open-source vs slosed-source things, which are happening.
* [Facebook Llama](https://www.llama.com/), is an open-source model. The models released by [Open AI](https://openai.com/), are usually closed-source, which means they don't release the the architecture, i.e., not too many things are known about the model itself.
* The gap between the open-source and closed-source models is slowly decreasing.
* Now, __TEXT__ is one thing right.

#### What is GenAI?
* __GenAI__ is a broader subset and it includes __language, video, audio, 3D models__, all the things.

*  [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), is a tool which helps you build LLM apps, but again it's not useful.
