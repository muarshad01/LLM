## Build an LLM from Scratch

#### Instructor
* My name is __Dr. Raj Dander__. I graduated from IIT Madras with a BTech in ME in 2017. After that, I did my PhD from the MIT. I graduated from MIT with a PhD in ML in 2022. Since then, I've come back to India and we are all on a mission to basically make AI accessible to everyone. At [Vizura] (https://www.youtube.com/@vizuara)__, which is our YouTube channel, we have made several playlists now on ML on DL. The main approach or the philosophy, which we really follow, when we teach, is to __teach everything from the basics__, i.e., not to assume anything. Teach you the __nuts and bolts__ of every single concept. 

* We all know that __LLM and GenAI__ are transforming everything around us. But many people when they are learning about this field are making __one common mistake__: they directly-switch to the applications, they directly-run some __Google-Collab notebook__. They follow some YouTube video and directly-run a code.
   * But very few people really understand how LLM actually work?
   * Very few people actually know the __nuts and the bolts__, which make LLM really so powerful.
   * Wouldn't be it amazing if you can __build an LLM completely from scratch?__
   * Teach to you everything from the basics as a beginner without assuming anything.


#### My story of learning LLMS:
* What exists right now ( the material which is already available on the internet for learning LLMs)?
* Why it is so inadequate?
* Why it is so insufficient and what we are trying to do new with this playlist?

#### How LLMS looked like in maybe 1960s(field of NLP)?
* One of the first __Chatbots__, which humans developed, is called as __ELIZA__. It was supposed to be a therapist, and let's see how it works:
   * First choose your language, so I'm choosing English.
   * Eliza: How do you do. Please tell me your problem?
   * You: I am trying to learn about LLMs. But I am finding it difficult. Could you provide some resources for me to start with.
   * Eliza: It is because you're trying to learn about LLM that you came to me.
   * You: yes 
   * Eliza: You seem to be quite positive.
   * You: yes
   * Eliza: You are sure.
* You see this conversation is proceeding nowhere. This was the state of LLMs 50 to 60 years 50 to 60 years back. iIt's not very good right.


#### 5:15: Fast forward to __LLM: ChatGPT__
* What are LLMs?
* I am trying to learn about LLMs tell me some resources?
* You'll see the response by __ChatGPT__. It's extremely useful, it's to the point and it gives me books, it gives me online courses, it gives me research papers, this is exactly what I need.
* We are living in an age where we should be very lucky that the research on NLP and LLMs is at such a stage where __LLM such as GPT__ are very powerful they are very sophisticated.
* There are several more open-source vs slosed-source things, which are happening as I'm making. __Facebook Llama 3.1__, which is one of their most capable LLM up till date and this is an open-source model. The models released by __Open AI__, are usually closed-source, which means they don't release the the architecture, i.e., not too many things are known about the model itself.
* Now in 2024, you can see the gap between the open-source and closed-source models is slowly decreasing. When __Llama 3.1__ is released, you can see that it performs at the same level as __GPT-4__, which is closed Source.
* Now, __TEXT__ is one thing right.

#### What is GenAI?
* __GenAI__ is a broader subset and it includes __language, video, audio, 3D models__, all the things.

#### Book: Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka (Author)

*  __LangChain__, is a tool which helps you build LLM apps, but again it's not useful.
*  You need to know how to build a entire LLM from scratch.
